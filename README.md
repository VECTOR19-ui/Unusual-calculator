# Unusual-calculator
This is a console app that I made for Windows. With 
this we can perform different kinds of mathematical 
operations. The reason why I called it unusual is that
it is represented in a casual way. This app contains 
calculations like:
Arithmetic
Factorial
Prime number
Number system conversion
Multiplication table
Physics basics 
HCF and LCM
Matrix
